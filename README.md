# BrainBoost

BrainBoost is an iOS app that allows young children to develop cognitive math skills through short, timed challenges.

Studies have shown that short, timed challenges have been more successful in developing cognitive math skills in young children compared to longer assessments. These short challenges help mitigate lapses in attention and allow students to strengthen their quantitative "muscle memory". BrainBoost provides students with 1 minute math challenges where each correct answer is worth 1 point. The objective is to answer as many questions as possible before the timer expires. High scores are tracked over all completed challenges by category to encourage students to improve (or "boost") their scores.
